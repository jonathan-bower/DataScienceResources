## Data Science Resources

Hello and welcome to the Data Science Resources repo.  I originally built this repo so that I could have a location to host resources that are helpful to me.  Through building the repo I realized that other people might be also be interested. I have tried to curate content on data science topics, high quality resources to learn from, and relevant blog posts.

The intended goal was to cover more than just the technical component of data science.  I have tried to find topics that cover building data science teams, business practices, use-cases, product metrics and data science career paths.  Hope this is helpful

## Data Science Getting Started
Data Science is a multidisciplinary field covering at the very minimum - statistics, programming, machine learning [Drew Conway's venn diagram](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram) or [Cheat Sheet of a Modern Data Scientist](http://www.marketingdistillery.com/2014/08/30/data-science-skill-set-explained/).  These topics are covered throughout this repo.  I personally find the best way to learn a topic is to get my hands dirty quickly - with that in mind I would get to work in python and then implement different tools or theory into my toolkit as they are understood.  If you haven't used python before I would strongly urge you to use the codecademy course to familiarize yourself with the content and how to program.  Good luck and have fun.

A note about order - I framed the contents in the Pipeline & Tools section order of the data pipeline starting with acquisition, exploratory data analysis, cleaning data, model section & evaluation and then visualization.
